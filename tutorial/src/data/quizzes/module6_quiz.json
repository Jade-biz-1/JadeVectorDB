      "difficulty": "easy",
      "multipleAnswers": true,
      "options": [
        "Horizontal scalability for handling more data",
        "High availability and fault tolerance",
        "Improved search performance through parallelization",
        "Reduced storage costs"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": [0, 1, 2],
      "explanation": "Distributed deployment provides horizontal scalability, high availability, and improved performance through parallel processing. It doesn't necessarily reduce storage costs as data is often replicated for fault tolerance.",
      "hints": [
        "Multiple answers may be correct",
        "Think about benefits of distributed systems",

      "question": "Sharding distributes vectors across multiple nodes based on a partitioning strategy.",
      "points": 10,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Sharding is the process of partitioning data across multiple nodes. JadeVectorDB supports hash-based, range-based, and vector-based sharding strategies to distribute vectors evenly.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about how distributed databases partition data",

      "points": 10,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "options": [
        "To provide fault tolerance and high availability",
        "To improve write performance",

        "To enable vector compression"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Replication creates copies of data across multiple nodes to ensure availability if a node fails. While it can improve read performance through load distribution, it actually increases storage requirements.",
      "hints": [

      "explanation": "Enable monitoring to collect performance metrics that can be scraped by Prometheus. The standard Prometheus port is 9090, though any available port can be used.",
      "hints": [

      ],
      "correctAnswer": [0, 1, 3, 4],
      "explanation": "Key production metrics include search latency, database size, cache hit rate, and error rates. Index build time is important during setup but not typically monitored in production runtime.",
      "hints": [
        "Multiple answers may be correct",

      "points": 10,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Vector compression (quantization) reduces storage size but typically involves some loss in search accuracy. Product quantization and scalar quantization are common techniques that trade accuracy for space efficiency.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about compression trade-offs",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "API key rotation is a security best practice that involves periodically changing API keys to limit the impact of potential key compromise. This reduces security risks without affecting functionality.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about security best practices",
        "Consider what happens if a key is compromised",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": [0, 1, 2],
      "explanation": "Recommended backup strategies include full snapshots, incremental backups, and point-in-time recovery. Backing up only the index without vectors would be incomplete and prevent full restoration.",
