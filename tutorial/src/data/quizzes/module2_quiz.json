      "correctAnswer": [0, 1, 2, 3],
      "explanation": "JadeVectorDB supports all CRUD operations: Create/Store for adding new vectors, Read/Retrieve for fetching vectors, Update for modifying existing vectors, and Delete for removing vectors.",
      "hints": [
        "All standard database operations should be available",

      "points": 10,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Batch operations are significantly more efficient because they reduce network overhead, enable database optimizations, and process multiple vectors in a single transaction.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about network and processing overhead",
        "Consider how databases optimize bulk operations",

        }
      ],
      "explanation": "When updating a vector, you can modify its metadata by providing new metadata fields. The update operation can modify metadata while keeping the vector values unchanged.",
      "hints": [
        "Metadata is an object that can contain arrays",
        "Tags are typically stored as an array of strings",
        "Review the update vector example"

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "JadeVectorDB validates that all vectors match the configured dimension. If the dimension doesn't match, the operation fails with a validation error to maintain data integrity.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about data integrity requirements",
        "Remember that dimension must be consistent",

      "points": 10,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "options": [
        "10-50 vectors per batch",
        "100-1000 vectors per batch",
        "10,000+ vectors per batch",
        "It doesn't matter, use any size"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The recommended batch size is 100-1000 vectors per batch. This balances network efficiency with memory usage. Smaller batches waste network overhead, while very large batches may exceed memory limits or timeout constraints.",
      "hints": [
        "Consider both network efficiency and memory constraints",

      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "You cannot change a vector's dimension after storage. All vectors in a database must have the same dimension as configured during database creation. To use a different dimension, you need to create a new database.",
      "hints": [
