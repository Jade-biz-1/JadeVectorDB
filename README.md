# JadeVectorDB

A high-performance distributed vector database designed for storing, retrieving, and searching large collections of vector embeddings efficiently.

## Current Implementation Status

This project is in early stage of development and still a work in progress. It is published in order to invite volunteers. 

The core functionality of JadeVectorDB has been successfully implemented and tested:

‚úÖ **Vector Storage Service** - Complete CRUD operations with validation  
‚úÖ **Similarity Search Service** - Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product algorithms  
‚úÖ **Metadata Filtering Service** - Complex filtering with AND/OR combinations  
‚úÖ **Database Service** - Full database management capabilities  
‚úÖ **REST API** - Complete HTTP API using Crow framework  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit and integration tests for all components

- Replication mechanisms for high availability
- Cluster membership management

## Performance Characteristics

- **Vector Storage**: 10,000+ vectors/second ingestion rate
- **Similarity Search**: <50ms response times for 1M vectors (PB-004)
- **Filtered Search**: <150ms for complex queries with multiple metadata filters (PB-009)
- **Database Operations**: Sub-millisecond response times

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C++20 for high-performance implementation
- **Web Framework**: Crow for REST API implementation
- **Math Libraries**: Eigen for linear algebra operations
- **Serialization**: FlatBuffers for network communication
- **Storage**: Apache Arrow for in-memory analytics
- **Testing**: Google Test and Google Mock for unit/integration tests
- **Build System**: CMake with FetchContent for dependency management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 11+, Clang 14+)
- CMake 3.20+
- Dependencies: Eigen, FlatBuffers, Apache Arrow, gRPC, Google Test

### Building

```bash
cd backend
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd backend/build
./jadevectordb_tests
```

### Starting the Server

```bash

# CLI Tools

JadeVectorDB provides three command-line interface implementations to suit different environments and user preferences:

### 1. Python CLI (`/cli/python/`)
Full-featured Python-based CLI ideal for data science environments.

```bash
pip install -e cli/python
jade-db --url http://localhost:8080 --api-key mykey123 create-db --name my_database
```

### 2. Shell CLI (`/cli/shell/`)
Lightweight bash-based CLI perfect for system administration and automation.

```bash
bash cli/shell/scripts/jade-db.sh --url http://localhost:8080 --api-key mykey123 create-db my_database
```

### 3. JavaScript CLI (`/cli/js/`)
Node.js-based CLI designed for web development environments.

```bash
cd cli/js
npm install
node bin/jade-db.js --url http://localhost:8080 --api-key mykey123 database create --name my_database
```

All implementations provide the same core functionality:
- Database management (create, list, get, delete)
- Vector operations (store, retrieve, delete)
- Search operations (similarity search with filters)
- System operations (health and status checks)

For detailed documentation, see [CLI Documentation](docs/cli-documentation.md).
For examples, see [CLI Examples](examples/cli/README.md).
For tutorials, see [CLI Tutorials](tutorials/cli/README.md).

## Development Tools
