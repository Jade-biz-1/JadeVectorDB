# JadeVectorDB

A high-performance distributed vector database solution designed for modern AI and machine learning applications.

## Overview

JadeVectorDB is a high-performance, distributed vector database built from the ground up for scalability and performance. It supports fast similarity search, distributed deployment, and rich metadata filtering capabilities.

### Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast similarity searches with response times under 100ms
- **Distributed Architecture**: Master-worker pattern with automatic failover and data sharding
- **Multiple Indexing Algorithms**: Support for HNSW, IVF, and LSH algorithms with configurable parameters
- **Rich Metadata Support**: Combined similarity and metadata filtering
- **Embedding Integration**: Direct integration with popular embedding models (Hugging Face, local models, commercial APIs)
- **API Support**: REST and gRPC APIs for flexible integration
- **Multi-language SDKs**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and other language clients
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Built-in health checks, metrics, and distributed tracing

## Architecture

JadeVectorDB uses a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Backend**: C++20 services for high-performance vector operations
- **Frontend**: Next.js web UI with shadcn components
- **CLI**: Python and shell-based command-line tools
