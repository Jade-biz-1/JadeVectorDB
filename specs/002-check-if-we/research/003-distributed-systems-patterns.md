## 3. Consensus Algorithms (Raft vs. Paxos)

### Overview

Raft and Paxos are two of the most well-known consensus algorithms used in distributed systems. They are both designed to ensure that a distributed system can continue to operate correctly even in the presence of failures. The main difference between them is that Raft was designed to be more understandable than Paxos [1].

### Paxos

Paxos is a family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors. It was first proposed by Leslie Lamport in 1989 [2]. Paxos is notoriously difficult to understand and implement correctly.

### Raft

Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It is equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. It was developed by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout at Stanford University [1].

### Key Differences

| Feature | Raft | Paxos |
|---|---|---|
| **Understandability** | Designed for understandability | Difficult to understand |
| **Leader Election** | Only servers with up-to-date logs can become leaders | Any server can become a leader |
| **Log Management** | Processes log entries in-order | Can allow out-of-order decisions |

### Conclusion

For JadeVectorDB, **Raft** is the recommended consensus algorithm. Its focus on understandability makes it a more practical choice for building a reliable distributed system.

## 4. Data Sharding Strategies

### Overview

Data sharding is a technique used to horizontally scale databases. In the context of vector databases, sharding is crucial for handling large datasets and high query volumes. Sharding partitions the data into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards, which are distributed across multiple nodes.

### Sharding Strategies

*   **Hash-based Sharding**: This is the simplest sharding strategy. It uses a hash function to distribute data evenly across shards. While it is easy to implement, it does not take into account vector similarity, which can lead to inefficient queries.
*   **Clustering-based Sharding**: This strategy groups similar vectors together in the same shard. This can significantly improve query performance, as the search can be limited to a smaller number of shards. However, it can also lead to hotspots if some clusters are more popular than others.
*   **Metadata-based Sharding**: This strategy shards data based on metadata fields. This is useful for multi-tenant systems or when queries often include metadata filters.

### Challenges

*   **Increased Latency**: Querying multiple shards can increase latency due to network overhead.
*   **Result Merging**: Merging results from multiple shards and re-ranking them is a complex problem.
*   **Load Imbalance**: Uneven data distribution or query patterns can lead to hotspots.

### Conclusion

For JadeVectorDB, a **hybrid approach** that combines clustering-based sharding with metadata-based sharding is recommended. This will allow for efficient similarity search while also providing the flexibility to handle multi-tenancy and metadata-based filtering.

## 5. Vector Compression and Quantization

### Overview

Vector compression techniques are used to reduce the memory footprint of vector embeddings. This is especially important for large-scale similarity search, as it can significantly reduce storage costs and improve query performance.

### Quantization Techniques

*   **Product Quantization (PQ)**: This technique decomposes a vector into several sub-vectors and quantizes each sub-vector independently. This is a lossy compression technique, but it can achieve high compression ratios with a small impact on search accuracy [5].
*   **Scalar Quantization (SQ)**: This technique converts floating-point values into integers. It is a simpler technique than PQ, but it can still provide significant memory savings with minimal information loss.
*   **Binary Quantization (BQ)**: This technique converts each component of a vector into a single bit. This provides the highest compression ratio, but it can also have the largest impact on search accuracy.

### Impact on Search Accuracy

Vector compression is a trade-off between memory usage and search accuracy. Higher compression ratios lead to lower memory usage but also lower search accuracy. The impact on search accuracy can be mitigated by using techniques like rescoring, where the top-k results from the compressed vectors are re-ranked using the original, uncompressed vectors.

### Conclusion

For JadeVectorDB, a combination of **Product Quantization (PQ)** and **Scalar Quantization (SQ)** is recommended. This will provide a good balance between memory usage and search accuracy. **Binary Quantization (BQ)** could also be supported as an option for users who require the highest possible compression ratio.

## 6. Network Partition Handling and Eventual Consistency

### Overview

Network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems. The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance [6]. Since partition tolerance is a must for any distributed system, a choice must be made between consistency and availability.

### Consistency vs. Availability

*   **Consistency (CP)**: In a CP system, the system will return an error or timeout if it cannot guarantee that the data is up-to-date. This is the best choice for applications that require strong consistency, such as financial systems.
*   **Availability (AP)**: In an AP system, the system will always return a response, even if the data is not up-to-date. This is the best choice for applications that require high availability, such as social media applications.

### Eventual Consistency

Eventual consistency is a model used in many AP systems. It guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value. This is achieved by replicating data across multiple nodes and allowing for temporary inconsistencies between the replicas.

### Conflict Resolution

When a network partition is healed, there may be conflicting updates that need to be resolved. Common conflict resolution strategies include "last write wins" or application-specific logic.

### Conclusion

For JadeVectorDB, an **AP system with eventual consistency** is the recommended approach. This will provide high availability, which is crucial for a database system. The impact of returning slightly stale data is acceptable for most similarity search use cases. A "last write wins" conflict resolution strategy should be used to resolve conflicts.

## 7. Summary

This research has provided an overview of distributed systems patterns relevant to JadeVectorDB. The key findings are:

*   **Raft** is the recommended consensus algorithm due to its focus on understandability.
*   A **hybrid sharding strategy** that combines clustering-based and metadata-based sharding is recommended to provide a balance of performance and flexibility.
*   A combination of **Product Quantization (PQ)** and **Scalar Quantization (SQ)** is recommended for vector compression to balance memory usage and search accuracy.
*   An **AP system with eventual consistency** is the recommended approach for handling network partitions to ensure high availability.

By implementing these patterns, JadeVectorDB can achieve high performance, scalability, and availability.
