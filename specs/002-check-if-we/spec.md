# Feature Specification: High-Performance Distributed Vector Database

**Feature Branch: `002-check-if-we``  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We are going to develop a Vector Database and some of the basic requirements are: 1. We need to build the solution from scratch using original code while being able to study and reference existing solutions for algorithmic concepts. 2. It should be very high performance and scalable using approaches like multi-threading or distributed architecture with master-worker patterns and data sharding. 3. Target server platforms with support for concurrent operations. 4. There should be API layer to interact with the Vector Database to handle database creation, vector storage, similarity search, indexing, data cleaning, archival, status, monitoring, and all such features needed from a professional backend server. 5. There should be facility to carry out the very fast search (such as similarity search, cosine similarity, etc.) 6. There should be facility to create the configuration of the deployment (master, nodes, ports, IP Addresses, Vector Dimensions, Size of individual item, and other relevant items for vector databases.) 7. There should be facility to create the vector embeddings from the submitted text and store along with the index update. As the list is not exhaustive, apart from these basic feature, I suggest doing exhaustive research on the features that Vector Databases can have and create bucket lists of features such as must have, good to have, may be needed, etc. Also, create a cross-metrix with the features bucket and priority of implementation (such as High, Medium, Low, etc. ) and update the specification document appropriately."



## Executive Summary

This document outlines the specification for a new high-performance, distributed vector database designed to be built from scratch. The primary goal of this project is to deliver a scalable and resilient solution for storing, indexing, and searching large volumes of vector embeddings with high efficiency.

The core features of the database include:
- **High-Performance Search:** Support for fast and accurate similarity searches (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) using advanced indexing algorithms like HNSW, IVF, and LSH.
- **Distributed Architecture:** A master-worker architecture that supports horizontal scaling, data sharding, and automatic failover to ensure high availability and resilience.
- **Comprehensive API:** A complete set of APIs (REST and gRPC) for all database operations, including database creation, vector management, and complex search queries.
- **Flexible Data Model:** Support for rich metadata associated with vectors, enabling powerful filtered searches that combine semantic and structural criteria.
- **Integrated Embedding Generation:** Optional capabilities to generate vector embeddings from raw data (text, images) using various popular models.

The project will be developed in C++ for maximum performance and will follow a microservices architecture. It is designed for deployment on modern server platforms, including cloud and on-premises environments, with support for containerization and orchestration.

This specification details the functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, API design, data persistence strategy, and a phased implementation roadmap. It also covers essential aspects like security, testing, documentation, and legal considerations to guide the development of a production-ready system.


## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Vector Storage and Retrieval (Priority: P1)

As a database user, I want to store vector embeddings with associated metadata and retrieve them later for similarity searches, so that I can build applications that understand semantic relationships between documents, images, or other data types.

**Why this priority**: The core function of a vector database is to store and retrieve vector embeddings. Without this basic functionality, the system has no value. This forms the foundation for all other capabilities.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow uploading vectors with metadata, storing them persistently, and retrieving them by ID. The functionality can be tested without any other features and delivers immediate value by enabling basic vector storage and retrieval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty database, **When** I store a vector embedding with metadata, **Then** the vector is successfully stored and I can retrieve it by its unique identifier
2. **Given** a database with stored vectors, **When** I request a vector by its ID, **Then** the correct vector with its metadata is returned
3. **Given** a vector database is running, **When** I attempt to store a malformed vector, **Then** the system returns an error message and does not store the invalid vector

---

### User Story 2 - Similarity Search (Priority: P1)

As a database user, I want to perform similarity searches to find vectors that are semantically similar to a query vector, so that I can implement applications like recommendation engines, semantic search, or content similarity detection.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary value proposition of vector databases - finding semantically similar items. This functionality is essential for any practical use case of a vector database.

**Independent Test**: The system should accept a query vector and return the most similar stored vectors based on a similarity metric like cosine similarity. This functionality can be tested independently and delivers core value by enabling semantic search capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a database with stored vectors, **When** I submit a query vector for similarity search, **Then** the system returns the K most similar vectors based on cosine similarity
2. **Given** a database with stored vectors, **When** I submit a query vector with a similarity threshold, **Then** the system returns all vectors that meet or exceed the specified threshold
3. **Given** a vector database with indexing enabled, **When** I perform a similarity search, **Then** the search returns results within acceptable time constraints (less than 100ms for datasets under 1 million vectors)

---

### User Story 3 - Advanced Similarity Search with Filters (Priority: P2)

As a database user, I want to perform similarity searches with metadata filtering (semantic + structural search), so that I can find vectors that match both content similarity and specific criteria like date ranges, categories, or user permissions.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for real-world applications where users need to combine semantic similarity with structured filtering, enabling more precise and relevant search results.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow combining vector similarity search with metadata filters. This can be tested independently and provides significant value by enabling more sophisticated search capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a database with vectors and metadata, **When** I submit a query vector with metadata filters, **Then** the system returns vectors that match both similarity and filter criteria
2. **Given** a database with vectors and metadata, **When** I submit a query with complex filter combinations, **Then** the system returns results matching all specified conditions
3. **Given** a large dataset with metadata, **When** I perform filtered similarity search, **Then** the results are returned within acceptable time constraints (less than 150ms)

---

### User Story 4 - Database Creation and Configuration (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I want to create new vector database instances with specific configurations, so that I can manage multiple databases with different vector dimensions, similarity algorithms, and performance characteristics.

**Why this priority**: Once storage and search are available, administration capabilities become critical for production use. This enables multi-tenancy and allows for optimization of databases based on specific use cases.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow creating a new database instance with specific parameters like vector dimensions and supported indexing algorithms. This can be tested independently, creating value by allowing database management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running vector database service, **When** I create a new database instance with specific vector dimensions, **Then** the database is created with the specified parameters and is ready for use
2. **Given** a vector database service, **When** I attempt to create a database with invalid parameters, **Then** the system returns an error message and does not create an improperly configured database
3. **Given** multiple database instances, **When** I query database configurations, **Then** each database's individual configuration details are returned correctly

---

### User Story 5 - Embedding Management (Priority: P2)

As a database user, I want to generate vector embeddings from raw data (like text or images) by leveraging a variety of integrated embedding models, so that I can easily convert my data into vectors without needing an external processing pipeline.

**Why this priority**: This capability is essential for the system's utility, as users expect to leverage state-of-the-art embedding technology directly. It simplifies the data ingestion workflow significantly.

**Independent Test**: The system should accept raw input (e.g., text) and a specified model, and then return the corresponding vector embedding. This can be tested independently and provides immediate value by enabling a complete "data-to-vector" workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a text input and a specified embedding model (e.g., BERT), **When** I request the vector embedding, **Then** the system returns the appropriate vector representation.
2. **Given** an image input and a specified embedding model (e.g., a CNN model), **When** I request the vector embedding, **Then** the system returns the appropriate vector representation.
3. **Given** raw data, **When** I request an embedding, **Then** the system allows me to choose from a list of available integrated models.
4. **Given** a running vector database with embedding capabilities, **When** I submit text for embedding, **Then** the system returns a vector representation of the text.

---

### User Story 6 - Distributed Deployment and Scaling (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I want to deploy the vector database in a distributed master-worker architecture, so that I can scale performance and handle larger datasets by distributing the load across multiple servers.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for meeting the high-performance and scalability requirements specified. Without distributed capabilities, the system would be limited in its practical applications.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow deployment across multiple servers with automatic master selection and worker coordination. This provides value by enabling horizontal scaling of the database system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple available servers, **When** the system starts, **Then** one server becomes the master and others become workers automatically
2. **Given** a distributed vector database with an active master, **When** the master server fails, **Then** the system automatically elects a new master and continues operation with minimal downtime
3. **Given** a distributed vector database with sharded data, **When** I perform vector operations, **Then** the operations are correctly routed to the appropriate servers

---

### User Story 7 - Vector Index Management (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I want to manage vector indexes (HNSW, IVF, LSH) with configurable parameters for different use cases, so that I can balance search accuracy and performance based on application requirements.

**Why this priority**: Different applications have different requirements for accuracy vs. performance. The ability to configure and choose appropriate indexing algorithms is crucial for optimization.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow creating and configuring different vector index types. This provides value by enabling performance optimization for specific requirements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a vector database instance, **When** I create an index with specific algorithm and parameters, **Then** the index is created with the specified configuration
2. **Given** a vector database with multiple index types available, **When** I specify which algorithm to use, **Then** the system creates the index using the requested algorithm
3. **Given** performance requirements, **When** I adjust index parameters, **Then** the system reflects the performance vs. accuracy trade-offs appropriately

---

### User Story 8 - Monitoring and Health Status (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and performance of the vector database, so that I can maintain system reliability and performance.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for production deployments where uptime and performance monitoring are critical.

**Independent Test**: The system should provide endpoints or tools to check system status, resource usage, and performance metrics. This provides value by enabling system observability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running vector database, **When** I request system status information, **Then** the system returns health metrics, resource usage, and operational status
2. **Given** a distributed vector database, **When** I check cluster status, **Then** the system returns the status of all servers and overall cluster health

---

### User Story 9 - Vector Data Lifecycle Management (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I want to manage the lifecycle of vector data including archival, cleanup, and retention policies, so that I can optimize storage costs while maintaining data availability.

**Why this priority**: As vector databases typically handle large amounts of data, lifecycle management is essential for long-term operational efficiency and cost optimization.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow configuring retention policies and performing data archival operations. This provides value by enabling automated data management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** vector data with age-based retention policy, **When** the retention period expires, **Then** the system automatically archives or removes the data according to policy
2. **Given** a vector database approaching storage limits, **When** I configure cleanup policies, **Then** the system removes data based on the configured criteria
3. **Given** archived vector data, **When** I need to access it, **Then** the system makes the data available after restoration from archive

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the system receives vectors with incorrect dimensions?
- How does the system handle requests when distributed servers are temporarily unavailable?
- What occurs when the database reaches its storage capacity limits?
- How does the system handle requests during master failover?
- What happens when an indexing algorithm encounters malformed or corrupted data?
- How does the system handle requests when embedding models are temporarily unavailable?
- What occurs when there are network partitions in the distributed system?
- How does the system handle high-volume concurrent requests that could overwhelm individual nodes?
- What happens when vector data is updated while an index rebuild is in progress?

> **Note:** The following data models are representative examples based on industry standards (e.g., Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant). The actual architecture and design will define these models in greater detail, including schema evolution, extensibility, and operational metadata.

## Security Threat Model

**Note:** This threat model is a preliminary analysis based on the initial system design. It is not exhaustive and MUST be revisited and expanded once the architecture, data models, and deployment scenarios are finalized. The goal of this section is to establish a framework for thinking about security, which will be made more concrete in future revisions.

We will use the **STRIDE** methodology to categorize potential threats.

### STRIDE Threat Analysis

#### 1. Spoofing (Pretending to be someone or something else)
- **Threat:** A malicious client could spoof the identity of a legitimate user or administrator to gain unauthorized access to the API.
- **Threat:** A rogue worker node could attempt to join the cluster by spoofing the identity of a legitimate node.
- **Mitigation (Preliminary):** Strong API key-based authentication (NFR-001), mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-node communication, and a secure node registration process.

#### 2. Tampering (Modifying data or code)
- **Threat:** An attacker with access to the network could intercept and modify data in transit between services or between a client and the API (Man-in-the-Middle attack).
- **Threat:** A malicious actor with access to the underlying storage could tamper with vector data or metadata at rest, corrupting the database or poisoning search results.
- **Mitigation (Preliminary):** Enforce TLS/SSL for all communications (NFR-003), implement data-at-rest encryption, use checksums or digital signatures to verify data integrity.

#### 3. Repudiation (Claiming you didn't do something)
- **Threat:** A user could perform a malicious action (e.g., delete a database) and later deny having done so.
- **Threat:** An administrator could make a critical configuration change and claim it was an accident or that they were not responsible.
- **Mitigation (Preliminary):** Comprehensive and immutable audit logging for all user and administrative actions (NFR-004). Logs should be securely stored and protected from tampering.

#### 4. Information Disclosure (Exposing information to unauthorized individuals)
- **Threat:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability to read sensitive vector data or metadata they are not authorized to access.
- **Threat:** Configuration files, environment variables, or logs containing secrets (API keys, passwords) could be accidentally exposed.
- **Threat:** A vulnerability could allow a user in one tenant to access data belonging to another tenant in a multi-tenant deployment.
- **Mitigation (Preliminary):** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (NFR-002), encryption in transit (NFR-003) and at rest, strict secret management practices (e.g., using a secrets vault), and robust data isolation in multi-tenant architectures.

#### 5. Denial of Service (DoS) (Making the system unavailable to legitimate users)
- **Threat:** An attacker could flood the API with a high volume of computationally expensive search queries, overwhelming the system.
- **Threat:** A malicious user could ingest a large volume of malformed data, causing services to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Threat:** An attacker could target the master node, bringing down the entire cluster if failover mechanisms are not robust.
- **Mitigation (Preliminary):** API rate limiting, input validation, resource quotas per user/tenant, robust automatic failover for the master node (FR-004), and circuit breakers (NFR-014).

#### 6. Elevation of Privilege (Gaining capabilities without authorization)
- **Threat:** A vulnerability could allow a regular user to gain administrative privileges, giving them full control over the database.
- **Threat:** A compromised worker node could potentially gain control over the master node or other worker nodes.
- **Mitigation (Preliminary):** Strict enforcement of RBAC (NFR-002), principle of least privilege for all system components, sandboxing of services (e.g., using containers), and regular security audits and penetration testing.

### Action Items for Future Revisions
- **Action:** Once the architecture is finalized, create detailed data flow diagrams (DFDs) for key processes (e.g., query execution, data ingestion, cluster management).
- **Action:** Perform a detailed STRIDE analysis on each DFD to identify more specific threats and trust boundaries.
- **Action:** Define concrete mitigation strategies for each identified threat and map them to specific functional or non-functional requirements.
- **Action:** Develop a security testing plan that includes tests for the identified threat scenarios.

## Architecture and Design Considerations

### Detailed Architecture Document

A more detailed architecture document, including visual diagrams and data flow descriptions, is maintained in a separate file: `[architecture/architecture.md](./architecture/architecture.md)`.

**Note:** The specification in `spec.md` and the `architecture.md` document are intended to be tightly linked. Any changes to the system's architecture should be reflected in both documents to ensure consistency.

### Technology Stack

- **AD-001**: System SHALL be implemented primarily in C++ for high performance and memory efficiency
- **AD-002**: System SHALL leverage C++ standard libraries and select high-performance third-party libraries for vector operations
- **AD-003**: System SHALL use a microservices architecture pattern to enable independent scaling and deployment of services

### System Architecture

- **AD-004**: System SHALL implement a microservices architecture with proper considerations for vertical and horizontal scaling
- **AD-005**: System SHALL separate services for storage, search, and management functions
- **AD-006**: System SHALL support distributed deployment across multiple servers with clearly defined service boundaries
- **AD-007**: System SHALL implement service discovery mechanisms to manage service communication in a dynamic environment

## Data Migration Strategy

This section outlines a preliminary strategy for migrating data into JadeVectorDB. Given that the final data models, architecture, and deployment scenarios are still under development, this strategy is designed to be flexible and will be refined as the project matures.

### Guiding Principles
- **DM-001:** Migration tools and processes MUST prioritize data integrity, ensuring no loss or corruption of vectors or metadata during transfer.
- **DM-002:** The migration process SHOULD be designed to minimize downtime for applications that depend on the data.
- **DM-003:** The tools SHOULD be idempotent, allowing migration jobs to be safely retried in case of failure.
- **DM-004:** The process MUST include robust validation steps to verify that the migrated data is consistent and searchable in the new system.

### Potential Migration Scenarios

The migration tools should eventually support a variety of sources:

- **DM-005: Migration from other Vector Databases:** Provide utilities to import data from common vector database formats (e.g., exports from Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate). This may involve transforming data models and re-indexing.
- **DM-006: Migration from Traditional Databases:** Provide tools and guides for exporting data from SQL or NoSQL databases and generating the necessary vector embeddings for ingestion into JadeVectorDB.
- **DM-007: Bulk Data Ingestion from Files:** Support for ingesting data from standard file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet) where each row/record represents a data point to be converted into a vector.

### Phased Development Approach

The development of migration capabilities will follow a phased approach:

- **Phase 1 (Initial Tooling - High Priority):**
    - Develop a robust bulk ingestion API endpoint.
    - Create a CLI command for bulk import from a standardized file format (e.g., JSONL).
    - This phase focuses on enabling initial data loading, which is essential for testing and initial adoption.

- **Phase 2 (Connectors and Adapters for Import - Low Priority):**
    - **Note:** While important for lowering the barrier to adoption from competing platforms, the development of specific connectors for direct import is a lower priority than the core features of the database.
    - Develop specific connectors or adapters for importing data from one or two popular vector databases, based on research.
    - Provide clear documentation and tutorials for these migration paths.

- **Phase 3 (Advanced Migration Support - Future Consideration):**
    - Explore "live migration" or "zero-downtime migration" techniques where data is synchronized between the old and new systems in real-time.
    - Develop more comprehensive toolkits for migrating from a wider range of data sources.

### Research Action Items
*The following research needs have been identified to support the development of a comprehensive data migration strategy:*
- **Research Item:** Investigate the data export formats, APIs, and migration strategies of major existing vector databases (e.g., Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant).
- **Research Item:** Analyze best practices and tools for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for large-scale data migration into database systems.

## Glossary of Terms

- **ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor):** A class of algorithms for efficiently finding "close enough" neighbors in high-dimensional spaces, trading some accuracy for a significant speedup in search time compared to exact nearest neighbor search.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** An architectural pattern that separates the models and logic for reading data (Queries) from the models and logic for writing data (Commands).
- **Cosine Similarity:** A metric used to measure the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. It determines if two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction, making it useful for judging semantic similarity.
- **Dot Product:** A measure of the similarity between two vectors, which is influenced by both the angle between them and their magnitudes.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** A data integration process that involves collecting data from various sources (Extract), converting it into a usable format (Transform), and storing it in a target database (Load).
- **Euclidean Distance:** The straight-line "ordinary" distance between two points in Euclidean space. In the context of vectors, it measures how far apart the terminal points of the vectors are.
- **gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls):** A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework developed by Google. It is often used for inter-service communication in microservices architectures.
- **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World):** A graph-based ANN indexing algorithm that creates a multi-layered graph structure to enable fast and accurate similarity searches.
- **IVF (Inverted File):** An indexing method that partitions vector data into clusters. During a search, only a subset of these clusters is scanned, which significantly speeds up query times.
- **LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing):** An ANN technique that uses hash functions to group similar items into the same "buckets" with high probability, allowing for faster searching.
- **Master-Worker Architecture:** A distributed computing pattern where a single "master" node distributes tasks to multiple "worker" nodes and aggregates the results.
- **Replication:** The process of storing copies of data on multiple servers to improve data availability, reliability, and fault tolerance.
- **REST (Representational State Transfer) API:** An architectural style for designing networked applications, which uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and is widely used for web services.
- **Sharding:** The process of horizontally partitioning a large database into smaller, more manageable parts called "shards." Each shard is stored on a separate server instance, allowing the database to scale beyond the capacity of a single server.
- **Similarity Search:** The process of finding the most similar items (vectors) in a database to a given query item (vector), based on a specific distance or similarity metric.
- **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):** A statistical method for visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map.
- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):** A dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualization and for general non-linear dimension reduction.
- **Vector Database:** A specialized database designed to efficiently store, manage, and search large quantities of high-dimensional data in the form of vector embeddings.
- **Vector Embedding:** A dense, low-dimensional numerical representation of a piece of data (such as text, an image, or audio). These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the data, allowing for mathematical comparisons.
