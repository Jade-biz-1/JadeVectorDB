# Feature Specification: Database Metadata API

**Feature Branch**: `002-check-if-we`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Check if we have the API to get the list of databases metadata (such as their ID, name, etc.). If not, we need the API to access all metadata of the databases in our database. If you make any change in the spec.md, make the necessary changes in all required documents."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Database Administrator Accesses Database Metadata (Priority: P1)

As a database administrator, I want to retrieve a list of all available databases in the system along with their metadata (ID, name, creation date, size, status, etc.) so that I can monitor, manage, and maintain the database environment effectively.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical functionality since it enables administrators to get an overview of the database ecosystem, which is fundamental for operational tasks like capacity planning, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting the database metadata and verifying that it returns a complete list of databases with their metadata fields, delivering immediate visibility into the database infrastructure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** system has multiple databases, **When** admin requests database metadata, **Then** system returns complete list of databases with their metadata (ID, name, status, size, creation date)
2. **Given** system has no databases created, **When** admin requests database metadata, **Then** system returns an empty list with appropriate status code
3. **Given** system is running normally, **When** admin requests database metadata with authentication, **Then** system returns metadata for databases accessible to the user's permissions

### User Story 2 - Application Developer Queries Database Information (Priority: P2)

As an application developer, I want to programmatically access database metadata to understand database properties, availability, and status so that I can make informed decisions about database connections and usage in my applications.

**Why this priority**: This functionality enables developers to build more robust applications that can intelligently select databases based on their properties, leading to better resource utilization and application performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting database metadata and verifying that the returned information can be used to make decisions about database connections or operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has appropriate permissions, **When** developer queries database metadata, **Then** system returns relevant database information in a structured format
2. **Given** developer needs to select an appropriate database, **When** developer uses metadata query to filter databases, **Then** developer can make informed decisions based on database properties

### User Story 3 - System Monitoring Tool Fetches Database Status (Priority: P3)

As a system monitoring tool, I want to periodically fetch database metadata to track database health, usage statistics, and operational status so that I can alert administrators when issues arise or report on system performance.

**Why this priority**: This functionality enables proactive system monitoring, which is important for maintaining system reliability and performance, but is lower priority than direct user access.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting database metadata at regular intervals and verify that the data is consistent and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** monitoring tool needs database status, **When** monitoring tool requests metadata, **Then** system returns up-to-date database status information
2. **Given** database status changes, **When** monitoring tool queries metadata, **Then** system returns updated status information reflecting the current state

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the database system is under heavy load and metadata queries take longer than usual?
- How does the system handle access requests for database metadata when user permissions are restricted?
- What occurs when the system contains thousands of databases - does the API still perform efficiently?
- How does the system behave when trying to retrieve metadata for a database that is temporarily unavailable or in an error state?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a method to retrieve a comprehensive list of all databases with their metadata (ID, name, creation date, status, size, etc.)
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate and authorize requests according to user permissions for database access
- **FR-003**: System MUST return database metadata in a standardized, structured format
- **FR-004**: System MUST include essential database properties in metadata: database ID, database name, creation timestamp, current status (active, maintenance, error, etc.), storage size, number of records, and last access time
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle concurrent metadata requests efficiently without degrading performance
- **FR-006**: System MUST return appropriate status codes for different scenarios
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement pagination when the number of databases exceeds a configurable threshold [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the threshold for pagination?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Database Metadata**: Represents information about databases in the system, including: database ID (unique identifier), name (display name), creation timestamp, status (operational state), size (storage capacity used), record count (number of entries), access permissions, and last access time
- **Database Metadata Access Method**: A system component that provides programmatic access to database metadata, with appropriate authentication and authorization controls

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Database administrators can retrieve metadata for all databases within 2 seconds under normal system load
- **SC-002**: The system can handle at least 100 concurrent metadata API requests without performance degradation
- **SC-003**: The database metadata API achieves 99.9% availability during business hours
- **SC-004**: 95% of API requests return successfully with appropriate metadata
- **SC-005**: The database metadata API returns results with 99% accuracy (metadata is current and correct)
