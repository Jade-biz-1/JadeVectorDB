**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Status**: Redirect Document

## Notice

The task execution plan previously located at `specs/002-check-if-we/tasks.md` has been reorganized and moved to improve task management and tracking.

## New Location

All tasks are now tracked in the **TasksTracking/** folder at the root of the repository.

## Quick Links

- **Main TasksTracking Folder**: `/TasksTracking/`
- **README and Guide**: `/TasksTracking/README.md`
- **Current Status Dashboard**: `/TasksTracking/status-dashboard.md`
- **Overview**: `/TasksTracking/overview.md`

## Task Files by Phase

| Phase | File | Task Range |
|-------|------|------------|
| Setup & Foundational | `01-setup-foundational.md` | T001-T027 |
| Core Features | `02-core-features.md` | T028-T087 |
| Advanced Features | `03-advanced-features.md` | T088-T162 |

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Easier Navigation**: Tasks organized by feature area and phase
2. **Better Tracking**: Separate files for different work streams
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized task management
4. **No Duplication**: Each task exists in only one file
5. **Clear Status**: Dashboard shows current focus and progress

## For More Information

See `/TasksTracking/README.md` for detailed information on how to use the new task tracking system.
