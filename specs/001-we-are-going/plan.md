# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C++20 or later (for high-performance vector operations, SIMD optimizations, and modern concurrency features) - All backend services MUST be implemented in C++ as per the constitution requirement  
**Primary Dependencies**: Eigen (linear algebra), OpenBLAS/BLIS (vector operations), FlatBuffers (serialization), Apache Arrow (in-memory analytics), gRPC (service communication), Google Test (testing framework), Boost (utility libraries)  
**Storage**: Custom binary format optimized for vector operations with memory-mapped files for large dataset handling; supports Apache Arrow for in-memory operations and FlatBuffers for network serialization  
**Testing**: Google Test with Google Mock for unit and integration testing; Google Benchmark for performance testing; ThreadSanitizer for concurrency validation; specialized vector accuracy testing with statistical validation  
**Target Platform**: Linux server environments (Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 8+, RHEL 8+) with support for containerized deployment using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes; Web UI using Next.js framework with shadcn UI components; CLI with Python and shell script integration  
**Project Type**: Multi-project architecture with backend microservices (C++), web UI (Next.js), and CLI tools  
**Performance Goals**: Similarity searches return results for 1 million vectors in under 50ms with 95% accuracy; handle 10,000+ vectors per second ingestion; 99.9% availability with automatic failover under 30 seconds  
**Constraints**: Support for vector dimensions up to 4096; memory efficiency through vector compression (quantization); SIMD optimization for vector operations; configurable consistency models (eventual, strong, causal); Next.js UI with shadcn components for enhanced UX; CLI supporting both Python and shell script integration; All inter-service communication in the distributed system will be implemented in C++ as per constitution, with special attention to C++-based consensus mechanisms (Raft) and communication layers  
**Scale/Scope**: Support for datasets up to 1 billion vectors with horizontal scaling across 100+ worker servers; 1000+ concurrent users; multi-tenant architecture with configurable resource isolation; Web UI for administrators and data scientists; CLI for power users and automation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Performance-First Architecture**: All technical decisions prioritize performance benchmarks with special attention to vector similarity search performance and indexing efficiency; performance regression testing mandatory for all changes
- **Master-Worker Scalability**: System design supports horizontal scaling across thousands of concurrent users; data sharding uses range-based, hash-based, or vector-based strategies to optimize similarity search performance; worker nodes are stateless
- **Fault Tolerance**: Design includes retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation during failures; system continues operating during master failover and node failures without losing vector data integrity
- **C++ Implementation Standard**: All dependencies and coding standards align with C++ requirements; memory management follows RAII principles; SIMD optimizations utilized where appropriate; third-party dependencies carefully evaluated for performance
- **High Throughput Design**: I/O operations are asynchronous and non-blocking; concurrency patterns minimize resource contention; system supports batch operations for efficient vector ingestion and real-time updates
- **Vector Database Specific Considerations**: Design supports multiple indexing algorithms (HNSW, IVF, LSH, Flat Index) with configurable parameters; vector embeddings stored with associated metadata supporting combined similarity and metadata filtering; handles embedding models with dimensions up to 4096; includes caching mechanisms and vector compression techniques

**Structure Decision**: Multi-project architecture selected to separate concerns. The backend is implemented in C++ with microservices architecture for high performance. The frontend uses Next.js with shadcn UI components for enhanced user experience. The CLI provides both Python and shell script integration for different user needs. This structure allows independent development and scaling of each component.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Multi-language dependencies (C++ core with potential Python for ML models) | Direct integration of ML embedding models in production systems requires Python ML ecosystem | Pure C++ solutions for embedding would require duplicating complex ML infrastructure |
| Multi-project architecture (backend C++, frontend Next.js, CLI with Python/shell) | Separation of concerns and specialized technology for each component provides better maintainability and user experience | Single project would create technology conflicts and reduce specialized capabilities |
