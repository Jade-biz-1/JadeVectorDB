## Decision 1: Vector Indexing Algorithm Selection

### Summary
Research was conducted on vector indexing algorithms including HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World), IVF (Inverted File), and LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing), comparing their performance, accuracy, memory usage, build time, and dynamic capabilities.

### Conclusion
HNSW provides the best query performance (speed and accuracy) for most datasets, making it ideal for performance-focused applications. IVF offers a good balance between performance, memory usage, and build time, especially when combined with Product Quantization. LSH is fastest to build and has lowest memory usage but generally has lower accuracy.

| Algorithm | Speed | Accuracy | Memory Usage | Build Time | Dynamic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HNSW | Very Fast | Very High | High | Slow | Yes |
| IVF | Fast | High | Medium | Medium | No |
| LSH | Medium | Medium | Low | Very Fast | Yes |

### Recommendation
For JadeVectorDB, the choice of indexing algorithm should be tailored to the deployment scenario.
- For large-scale **distributed deployments**, **IVF with PQ** is the recommended algorithm. Its ability to perform targeted queries to a subset of shards provides superior scalability and performance.
- For **single-node deployments** or smaller clusters where performance on a single machine is the priority, **HNSW** is the recommended algorithm due to its high speed and accuracy.
- **LSH** remains a viable option for niche use cases where extremely fast build times and low memory usage are the primary concerns, and a trade-off in accuracy is acceptable.
The system should allow the indexing algorithm to be configured on a per-database basis to provide this flexibility.

### Decision
- **Configurability**: The indexing algorithm is configurable on a per-database basis. The system supports HNSW, IVF with PQ, and LSH.
- **Recommendation for Distributed Systems**: For large, distributed databases, **IVF with PQ** is the recommended default algorithm due to its superior query routing and scalability.
- **Recommendation for Single-Node Performance**: For single-node deployments or where maximum accuracy is the priority, **HNSW** is the recommended algorithm.
- **Tertiary Option**: **LSH** is available for specialized use cases where build time and memory are the primary constraints and lower accuracy is acceptable.

## Decision 2: Embedding Model Integration Approach

### Summary
Research was conducted on embedding model architectures, serving frameworks, and optimization techniques. The focus was on Transformer-based models, model serving solutions, and performance optimization methods.

### Conclusion
Transformer-based models, particularly BERT, are the state-of-the-art for generating contextualized embeddings. Various model serving frameworks offer different trade-offs depending on deployment requirements. Efficient data processing and model optimization techniques are essential for real-time performance.

### Recommendation
For JadeVectorDB, embedding generation should be based on Transformer architectures. The system should feature a flexible, pluggable "Embedding Provider" architecture to accommodate various model sources, providing users with maximum flexibility. The recommended integration paths are:
1.  **Direct Model Loading (via Hugging Face):** Natively support loading models from the Hugging Face Hub using their `transformers` library. This is ideal for users who want easy access to a vast range of open-source models that run within the JadeVectorDB environment.
2.  **Local API-driven Models:** Integrate with local inference servers like Ollama via an API client. This is for users who already have a local model serving setup.
3.  **External API-driven Models:** Connect to commercial embedding services (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Cohere) via their public APIs. This provides access to proprietary, state-of-the-art models without the need for local hosting.

For models loaded directly, optimization techniques like quantization and pruning should be implemented to ensure efficient real-time inference.

### Decision
- **Model Architecture**: Focus on Transformer-based models for embedding generation.
- **Integration Strategy**: Implement a pluggable "Embedding Provider" architecture to support multiple, configurable model sources:
    - **Direct Loading (Hugging Face):** Use the Hugging Face `transformers` library to download, cache, and run models directly from the Hub.
    - **Local API:** Provide connectors for local inference servers, with specific support for Ollama.
    - **External API:** Provide connectors for major commercial embedding APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini).
- **Configuration**: Allow users to configure the desired embedding provider and its specific parameters (e.g., Hugging Face model name, local API endpoint, external API key) on a per-database basis.
- **Optimization**: For directly loaded models (e.g., from Hugging Face), implement optimization techniques such as quantization and pruning for efficient performance.
- **Processing**: Utilize batching, caching, and efficient data preprocessing across all providers to optimize throughput and cost.

## Decision 3: Distributed Systems Patterns

### Summary
Research was conducted on consensus algorithms (Raft vs. Paxos), data sharding strategies, vector compression techniques, and network partition handling with eventual consistency mechanisms.

### Conclusion
Raft is recommended as the consensus algorithm due to its understandability.
