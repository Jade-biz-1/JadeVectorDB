- LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) approaches
- Comparison of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms and trade-offs between accuracy and speed

## 2. Embedding Models Integration

Investigate:
- Current embedding model architectures (BERT variants, Transformer-based models) and their computational requirements
- Model serving frameworks (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe) and integration approaches
- Efficient techniques for processing text, image, and other data types into vector embeddings
- Model quantization and optimization for real-time inference

## 3. Distributed Systems Patterns

Explore:
- Consensus algorithms (Raft vs. Paxos) for master election implementations
- Data sharding strategies optimized for vector similarity-based partitioning
- Vector compression techniques and quantization methods with impact analysis on search accuracy
- Network partition handling and eventual consistency mechanisms
