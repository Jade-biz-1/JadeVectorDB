# GPU Acceleration in JadeVectorDB

## Overview

JadeVectorDB provides optional GPU acceleration for vector operations to improve performance on compute-intensive tasks. The implementation follows a flexible architecture that automatically falls back to CPU computation when GPU is unavailable.

## Architecture

The GPU acceleration system consists of several key components:

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer
- `IDevice` interface abstracts different hardware types (CPU, CUDA, OpenCL)
- `CPUDevice` and `CUDADevice` implementations
- `DeviceManager` singleton for device detection and management

### 2. Vector Operations Abstraction
- `IVectorOperations` interface for vector computations
- `CPUVectorOperations` and `CUDAVectorOperations` implementations
- `VectorOperationsFactory` for creating appropriate implementations

### 3. Memory Management
- `GPUDeviceMemoryManager` for GPU memory allocation/deallocation
- `GPUDeviceMemory` RAII wrapper for automatic memory management
- `MemoryTransferManager` for host-device data transfers

### 4. Workload Balancing
- `WorkloadBalancer` for distributing work between CPU and GPU
- Multiple strategies (`SimpleThresholdStrategy`, `PerformanceBasedStrategy`)
- Automatic adjustment based on performance metrics

## Configuration

GPU acceleration can be enabled through configuration. The system will automatically detect available GPU hardware and use it when beneficial.

## Compilation

To compile with GPU support:
- Install CUDA toolkit (for NVIDIA GPUs)
- Define `CUDA_AVAILABLE` during compilation
- Link against CUDA runtime and cuBLAS libraries

Example CMake configuration:
```cmake
find_package(CUDAToolkit REQUIRED)
target_compile_definitions(your_target PRIVATE CUDA_AVAILABLE)
target_link_libraries(your_target ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})
```

## Performance Benefits

GPU acceleration provides significant performance improvements for:
- Large-scale similarity searches
- Batch vector operations
- High-dimensional vector computations

The workload balancer automatically determines optimal CPU/GPU distribution based on:
- Vector dimensions
- Number of vectors to process
- Historical performance metrics
- Available hardware resources

## Fallback Behavior

If GPU is not available or fails to initialize, the system seamlessly falls back to CPU computation without any loss of functionality. This ensures the application remains portable and can run on systems without dedicated GPUs.

## Implementation Details

The GPU acceleration implementation:

1. Uses a plugin architecture that allows easy addition of new hardware backends
2. Automatically detects available hardware at runtime
3. Caches performance metrics to optimize workload distribution
4. Provides RAII-based memory management to prevent leaks
5. Includes comprehensive error handling for robust operation

## CUDA Implementation Notes

The current implementation includes placeholders for CUDA functionality. Actual GPU kernels would need to be implemented for full performance benefits, using:
- CUDA kernels for parallel vector operations
- cuBLAS for optimized linear algebra operations
- Proper memory management to minimize host-device transfers
