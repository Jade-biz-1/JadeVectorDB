# Static Analysis Setup and Usage

This document explains how to set up and run static analysis tools for verifying C++ compliance and code quality in the JadeVectorDB project.

## Setting up Static Analysis Tools

First, install the required static analysis tools:

```bash
./scripts/setup-static-analysis-tools.sh
```

This script will install `clang-tidy` and `cppcheck` which are used for C++ compliance verification.

## Running Static Analysis

To run both clang-tidy and cppcheck on the codebase:

```bash
cd backend
python3 ../scripts/run-static-analysis.py
```

To run a specific tool only:

```bash
# Only run clang-tidy
python3 ../scripts/run-static-analysis.py --tool clang-tidy

# Only run cppcheck
python3 ../scripts/run-static-analysis.py --tool cppcheck
```

You can also specify a different source directory:

```bash
python3 ../scripts/run-static-analysis.py --source-dir my-source-directory
```

## What the Static Analysis Checks For

### Clang-Tidy
- Modern C++ best practices
- C++20 compliance
- Performance issues
- Potential bugs
- Code style consistency
- Security vulnerabilities

### Cppcheck
- Uninitialized variables
- Memory leaks
- Array out of bounds
- C++ standard compliance
- Performance issues
- Portability issues

## Integration with C++ Compliance Task

This static analysis setup is part of the broader C++ Implementation Standard Compliance (T189) task, which aims to:
- Run static analysis tools (clang-tidy, cppcheck)
- Perform dynamic analysis (Valgrind, TSan)
- Ensure full C++20 compliance across all modules

## Addressing Issues Found

When static analysis tools find issues:
1. Review the output carefully
2. Fix high-priority issues first (potential bugs, security vulnerabilities)
3. Update code to follow C++20 standards
4. Re-run analysis to confirm fixes

## Continuous Integration

These static analysis tools should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to:
- Catch issues early in the development process
- Ensure code quality standards are maintained
- Verify C++20 compliance across all modules
