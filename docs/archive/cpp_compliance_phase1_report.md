## Phase 1 Compliance Summary

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Compliant Areas
1. **Modern C++ Features**: Evidence of C++20 features usage throughout the codebase
2. **Smart Pointer Usage**: Extensive use of  and  for memory management
3. **RAII Implementation**: Proper RAII principles demonstrated with constructors/destructors
4. **Move Semantics**: Implementation of move constructors and operators
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent use of / for error handling
6. **Error Utilities**: Proper error handling utilities with contextual information
7. **Concurrency Patterns**: Appropriate use of threads, mutexes, and atomic operations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Requiring Further Review
1. **Exception Usage**: Some exception-related keywords found (needs verification for proper usage)
2. **C++20 Feature Adoption**: While features are used, comprehensive coverage verification needed
3. **Compilation Testing**: Full C++20 compilation verification recommended

### üîß Recommended Actions
1. Perform full compilation with C++20 standard and all warnings enabled
2. Run static analysis tools (clang-tidy, cppcheck) for code quality verification
3. Execute dynamic analysis (Valgrind, TSan) for memory and thread safety
4. Conduct comprehensive review of exception usage patterns
5. Verify complete adoption of C++20 features across all modules
