# Advanced Embedding Models in JadeVectorDB

## Overview

JadeVectorDB provides advanced embedding model capabilities that extend beyond the basic embedding generation. This includes support for state-of-the-art models, a custom model training framework, and model versioning with A/B testing capabilities.

## Components

### 1. Sentence Transformers Integration

Sentence Transformers are integrated to provide high-quality sentence and text embeddings. The system uses a pluggable architecture that allows for easy integration of new embedding models.

#### Key Features:
- Pre-trained models from Hugging Face Hub
- Multiple pooling strategies (mean, CLS token, etc.)
- Configurable normalization options
- Batch processing for efficiency

#### Implementation:
The `HuggingFaceEmbeddingProvider` class handles Sentence Transformers integration, allowing users to specify models like "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" directly in their queries.

### 2. CLIP Model Support for Multimodal Embeddings

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) models are supported to enable multimodal embeddings that can understand both text and image inputs semantically.

#### Key Features:
- Joint text and image embedding spaces
- Cross-modal retrieval capabilities
- Support for various vision-language tasks

#### Implementation:
Similar to Sentence Transformers, CLIP models are integrated using the same pluggable provider architecture, allowing for both text-to-image and image-to-text embeddings.

### 3. Custom Model Training Framework

The custom model training framework allows users to train and fine-tune embedding models for their specific use cases.

#### Key Components:
- **CustomModelTrainingService**: Main service for model training
- **CustomModelTrainingConfig**: Configuration for training jobs
- **TrainingDataset**: Structure for organizing training data

#### Features:
- Fine-tuning of existing models
- Training new models from scratch
- Support for various hyperparameters
- Progress tracking and callbacks
- Multiple output formats (ONNX, TorchScript, Hugging Face format)

#### Usage Example:
```cpp
CustomModelTrainingConfig config;
config.model_name = "my_custom_model";
config.base_model_id = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2";  // Optional, for fine-tuning
config.training_data_path = "/path/to/training/data";
config.output_path = "/path/to/save/model";
config.epochs = 10;
config.learning_rate = 0.001f;
config.batch_size = 32;

auto result = training_service->train_model(config, 
    [](int epoch, int batch, float loss, float accuracy) {
        std::cout << "Epoch " << epoch << ", Batch " << batch 
                  << " - Loss: " << loss << ", Accuracy: " << accuracy << std::endl;
    });
```

### 4. Model Versioning and A/B Testing System

The system includes comprehensive model versioning and A/B testing capabilities to manage model lifecycles and compare different model versions.

#### Key Components:
- **ModelVersioningService**: Main service for version management
- **ModelVersion**: Structure representing a specific model version
- **ABTestConfig**: Configuration for A/B testing
- **ABTestResults**: Results of A/B testing

#### Model Versioning Features:
- Semantic versioning for models (e.g., 1.0.0)
- Model activation/deactivation
- Version history tracking
- Metadata storage for each version

#### A/B Testing Features:
- Configurable traffic splitting between models
- Performance metric tracking
- Request distribution controls
- Real-time results monitoring

#### Usage Examples:

Creating a model version:
```cpp
ModelVersion version_info;
version_info.version_id = "v1_0_0_12345";
version_info.model_id = "my_model";
version_info.version_number = "1.0.0";
version_info.path_to_model = "/path/to/model_v1_0_0.onnx";
version_info.author = "model_developer";
version_info.changelog = "Initial model version with improved accuracy";
version_info.status = "inactive";  // Will be activated later

bool created = versioning_service->create_model_version("my_model", version_info);
```

Creating an A/B test:
```cpp
ABTestConfig config;
config.test_id = "ab_test_1";
config.model_ids = {"model_v1", "model_v2"};
config.traffic_split = {0.5f, 0.5f};  // 50/50 split
config.test_name = "Model V1 vs V2";
config.description = "Comparing two model versions for performance";
config.is_active = false;  // Start inactive

bool created = versioning_service->create_ab_test(config);
versioning_service->start_ab_test("ab_test_1");

// For each request, select a model based on A/B test configuration
std::string selected_model = versioning_service->select_model_for_ab_test("ab_test_1");

// Record usage to track metrics
versioning_service->record_model_usage("ab_test_1", selected_model, response_time_ms, success);
```

## Integration with Existing System

The advanced embedding models integrate seamlessly with the existing JadeVectorDB system:

1. **Provider Interface**: New embedding providers implement the `IEmbeddingProvider` interface
2. **Service Integration**: The `EmbeddingService` manages all providers uniformly
3. **API Endpoints**: New embedding models are accessible through existing API endpoints
4. **Storage**: Embeddings are stored using the same vector storage mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

- Model loading and caching strategies to minimize latency
- GPU acceleration support for computationally intensive models
- Batch processing for improved throughput
- Memory management optimized for large embedding models

## Security Considerations

- Model download verification and security scanning
- Access controls for model training and management operations
- Validation of training data sources
- Isolation of model execution environments

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**: Choose models appropriate for your specific use case
2. **Version Management**: Use versioning to track model improvements
3. **A/B Testing**: Always test new model versions in production with A/B tests
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor model performance metrics and latency
5. **Resource Management**: Plan for computational resources required by embedding models
