# Advanced Encryption in JadeVectorDB

## Overview

JadeVectorDB provides advanced encryption capabilities to secure vector data at rest and in transit. The system implements multiple encryption techniques including homomorphic encryption, field-level encryption, and automatic certificate management.

## Encryption Algorithms

### 1. AES-256-GCM
- **Type**: Symmetric encryption with authenticated encryption
- **Use Case**: General-purpose encryption with authentication
- **Key Size**: 256-bit keys
- **Mode**: Galois/Counter Mode for authenticated encryption

### 2. ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Type**: Stream cipher with authenticated encryption
- **Use Case**: Encryption where AES hardware acceleration is not available
- **Key Size**: 256-bit keys
- **Mode**: ChaCha20 stream cipher with Poly1305 authentication

### 3. Homomorphic Encryption
- **Type**: Simplified somewhat homomorphic encryption
- **Use Case**: Performing computations on encrypted data (limited operations)
- **Operations Supported**: Addition and scalar multiplication

## Key Management

### Key Management Service
The system provides a comprehensive key management service that handles:

- Key generation with cryptographically secure random values
- Key rotation with configurable intervals
- Key lifecycle management (creation, activation, deactivation, deletion)
- Key validation and integrity checking

### Key Configuration Options
- **Algorithm**: Specify the encryption algorithm to use with the key
- **Key Size**: Configurable key sizes based on algorithm
- **Expiration**: Automatic key expiration and rotation
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Option to use hardware-accelerated crypto when available

## Field-Level Encryption

### Configuration
Field-level encryption allows for encrypting specific fields within data structures:

```cpp
jadevectordb::encryption::EncryptionConfig config;
config.algorithm = jadevectordb::encryption::EncryptionAlgorithm::AES_256_GCM;
config.key_id = "my_key_id";

vector_storage->configure_field_encryption("user.email", config);
vector_storage->configure_field_encryption("user.ssn", config);
```

### Supported Fields
- Vector metadata fields (source, owner, tags)
- Vector data values
- Custom fields based on application requirements

## Homomorphic Encryption

### Capabilities
The system implements simplified homomorphic encryption that allows for:

- **Homomorphic Addition**: Adding encrypted values without decryption
- **Homomorphic Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying encrypted values by scalars

### Limitations
- Limited to specific operations for performance reasons
- Increased computational overhead compared to traditional encryption
- Not suitable for all types of computations

## Searchable Encryption

### Deterministic Encryption
For equality searches on encrypted data:

- Same plaintext always encrypts to same ciphertext
- Enables efficient equality comparisons
- Requires special handling for security considerations

### Order-Preserving Encryption
For range queries (simplified implementation):

- Maintains order relationships in encrypted data
- Enables range comparisons (less than, greater than)
- Trade-off between security and functionality

## Certificate Management

### Certificate Lifecycle
- **Generation**: Automated certificate creation with proper validity periods
- **Validation**: Comprehensive certificate validation including:
  - Expiration checks
  - Signature verification
  - Revocation status
- **Renewal**: Automatic renewal before expiration
- **Revocation**: Certificate revocation with proper tracking

### Certificate Rotation
- **Automatic Rotation**: Scheduled certificate renewal based on configurable thresholds
- **Monitoring Service**: Background service to monitor and rotate certificates
- **Graceful Transition**: Ensures service continuity during certificate changes

### Certificate Chain Management
- Support for certificate chains
- Proper validation of intermediate certificates
- Automated chain construction

## Configuration

### Encryption Manager Setup
```cpp
// Initialize encryption manager
auto encryption_manager = std::make_unique<EncryptionManager>();
auto kms = std::make_unique<KeyManagementServiceImpl>();
encryption_manager->initialize(std::move(kms));

// Enable encryption in vector storage
vector_storage->enable_encryption();
```

### Security Configuration Options
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms based on use case
- **Key Rotation Policies**: Configure automatic key rotation intervals
- **Certificate Validity**: Set appropriate certificate validity periods
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Enable hardware crypto when available

## Performance Considerations

### Trade-offs
- **Security vs. Performance**: Higher security levels increase computational overhead
- **Searchability vs. Security**: Searchable encryption reduces security
- **Real-time vs. Batch**: Different optimization strategies for different workloads

### Optimization Strategies
- **Selective Encryption**: Encrypt only sensitive fields
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Offload encryption to background threads
- **Caching**: Cache encryption keys and intermediate values
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use AES-NI or other hardware features

## Security Considerations

### Compliance
- Supports industry-standard algorithms (AES, ChaCha20)
- Proper key management practices
- Certificate lifecycle management

### Threat Mitigation
- Protection against side-channel attacks where possible
- Secure key generation and handling
- Proper certificate validation and revocation checking

## Integration with Vector Storage

The encryption system is seamlessly integrated with vector storage operations:

- `store_vector()` - Automatically encrypts vectors before storage
- `retrieve_vector()` - Automatically decrypts vectors after retrieval
- `batch_store_vectors()` - Encrypts batches of vectors efficiently
- `batch_retrieve_vectors()` - Decrypts batches of vectors efficiently

## Implementation Details

### Cryptographic Primitives
