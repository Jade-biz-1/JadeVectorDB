This document provides a comprehensive plan for enhancing test coverage in the JadeVectorDB system to meet the 90%+ coverage requirement. The plan includes an analysis of current test coverage, identification of gaps, and a roadmap for implementing comprehensive tests across all services.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Test Structure

The JadeVectorDB system currently has:
1. **Unit Tests**: Located in `backend/tests/unit/` directory
2. **Integration Tests**: Multiple integration test files (`test_*_integration.cpp`)
