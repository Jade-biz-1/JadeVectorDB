# Tasks for October 31st

Based on today's work implementing distributed services for JadeVectorDB, here are the tasks planned for tomorrow:

## 1. Complete Missing Method Implementations
- Implement any remaining stubbed methods in distributed services
- Fill in placeholder implementations with real functionality
- Ensure all declared methods in service headers have proper implementations

## 2. Enhance Distributed Service Integration
- Ensure all services properly coordinate with each other
- Implement proper error handling and failure recovery mechanisms
- Add validation for service configurations

## 3. Implement Security Audit Logging (NFR-004 and NFR-005)
- Create comprehensive audit logging for all user operations
- Implement configurable logging levels and output formats
- Add security event tracking for authentication and authorization

## 4. Performance Benchmarking Framework
- Develop benchmarking tools to validate performance requirements
- Add metrics collection and reporting capabilities
- Create performance tests for distributed operations

## 5. Distributed Functionality Integration Testing
- Write tests to verify distributed features work correctly
- Test cluster formation, node failure handling, and data replication
- Validate sharding and routing mechanisms

## 6. API and Architecture Documentation
- Document all distributed service APIs
- Create architecture documentation for the distributed system
- Add usage examples and configuration guides

## 7. Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- Implement Google Test-based unit tests for distributed services
- Create integration tests for distributed functionality
- Add stress tests for cluster operations

## 8. Security Implementation
- Complete authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Add security hardening features
- Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest

## 9. Containerization Setup
- Create Docker configurations for distributed deployment
- Set up Kubernetes manifests for cluster orchestration
- Add docker-compose files for easy cluster setup

This plan addresses all key points from the code review:
- Incomplete distributed features implementation
- Missing security audit logging
- Insufficient testing
- Missing documentation
- Performance validation requirements
