# JadeVectorDB Constitution

## Core Principles

### Performance-First Architecture
Every component must be designed with performance as the primary concern; All algorithms and data structures must be benchmarked for efficiency; Performance regression testing is mandatory for all changes; Special attention must be paid to vector similarity search performance and indexing efficiency.

### Master-Worker Scalability
The system must follow a master-worker architecture pattern; All worker nodes must be stateless and horizontally scalable to support thousands of concurrent users; Clear communication protocols between master and workers are required; Data must be sharded effectively using range-based, hash-based, or vector-based strategies to optimize similarity search performance.

### Fault Tolerance
The system must continue operating despite individual component failures; All critical operations must have retry mechanisms and circuit breakers; Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures are mandatory; The system must support graceful degradation during master failover and node failures without losing vector data integrity.

### C++ Implementation Standard
The entire codebase must be developed in C++ for high performance; All third-party dependencies must be carefully evaluated for performance impact; Memory management must follow RAII principles and modern C++ standards; Specialized vector processing and SIMD optimizations must be utilized where appropriate.

### High Throughput Design
All system components must be optimized for high throughput scenarios; Network I/O must be asynchronous and non-blocking; Resource contention must be minimized through efficient concurrency patterns; The system must support batch operations for efficient vector ingestion and real-time updates.

## Vector Database Specific Considerations

The system must support multiple indexing algorithms (HNSW, IVF, LSH, Flat Index) with configurable parameters for performance vs. accuracy trade-offs; Vector embeddings must be stored with associated metadata and support combined similarity and metadata filtering; The system must handle various embedding models (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, etc.) with appropriate vector dimensions up to 4096; Caching mechanisms must be implemented for frequently accessed vectors and query results; Vector compression techniques (quantization) must be supported to optimize storage and network usage.

## System Architecture Constraints

The technology stack shall be primarily C++ with support for system and network services; The architecture must support thousands of concurrent users and sessions; All components must be designed with thread safety in mind to ensure proper operation in multi-user scenarios; The system must implement configurable consistency models (eventual, strong, causal) for different use cases.

## Development Workflow

All code must undergo performance benchmarking before acceptance; Code reviews must specifically examine performance implications; Testing must include load testing scenarios that verify scalability requirements; Specialized testing for vector similarity accuracy and indexing performance must be included.

## Governance

All development must adhere to the performance and scalability principles outlined in this constitution; Amendments to these principles must be documented and approved by the core development team; All pull requests must be evaluated against these principles to ensure compliance.
