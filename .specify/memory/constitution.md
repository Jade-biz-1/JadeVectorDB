# JadeVectorDB Constitution

## Core Principles

### Performance-First Architecture
Every component must be designed with performance as the primary concern; All algorithms and data structures must be benchmarked for efficiency; Performance regression testing is mandatory for all changes.

### Master-Worker Scalability
The system must follow a master-worker architecture pattern; All worker nodes must be stateless and horizontally scalable to support thousands of concurrent users; Clear communication protocols between master and workers are required.

### Fault Tolerance
The system must continue operating despite individual component failures; All critical operations must have retry mechanisms and circuit breakers; Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures are mandatory.

### C++ Implementation Standard
The entire codebase must be developed in C++ for high performance; All third-party dependencies must be carefully evaluated for performance impact; Memory management must follow RAII principles and modern C++ standards.

### High Throughput Design
All system components must be optimized for high throughput scenarios; Network I/O must be asynchronous and non-blocking; Resource contention must be minimized through efficient concurrency patterns.

## System Architecture Constraints

The technology stack shall be primarily C++ with support for system and network services; The architecture must support thousands of concurrent users and sessions; All components must be designed with thread safety in mind to ensure proper operation in multi-user scenarios.

## Development Workflow

All code must undergo performance benchmarking before acceptance; Code reviews must specifically examine performance implications; Testing must include load testing scenarios that verify scalability requirements.

## Governance

All development must adhere to the performance and scalability principles outlined in this constitution; Amendments to these principles must be documented and approved by the core development team; All pull requests must be evaluated against these principles to ensure compliance.
