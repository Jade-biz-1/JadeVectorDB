## Optional/Lower Priority Tasks (Not Required for MVP)

The following tasks were originally planned but are considered **optional enhancements** and not required for the tutorial MVP:

### T215.17: Create real-world use case scenarios
**Status**: Optional Enhancement
**Rationale**: Core tutorials already cover practical examples. Real-world scenarios can be added based on user feedback.

### T215.18: Implement API validation and feedback
**Status**: Optional Enhancement
**Rationale**: Basic validation exists in code editor. Advanced validation can be added later.

### T215.19: Build performance metrics visualization
**Status**: Optional Enhancement
**Rationale**: Basic metrics shown in dashboard. Advanced performance visualization can be added based on demand.

### T215.20: Implement code export functionality
**Status**: Optional Enhancement
**Rationale**: Users can copy code from editor. Formal export feature can be added later.

### T215.22: Develop capstone project challenge
**Status**: Optional Enhancement
**Rationale**: Can be added after gathering user feedback on core tutorials.

### T215.23: Add customization options for tutorials
**Status**: Optional Enhancement
**Rationale**: Current tutorial flow is effective. Customization can be added based on user requests.

### T215.25: Implement responsive design for tutorial
**Status**: Partial - Desktop optimized
**Rationale**: Tutorial is functional on desktop. Mobile optimization can be prioritized later.

### T215.26: Integrate with API reference documentation
**Status**: Optional Enhancement
**Rationale**: Links to docs exist. Deeper integration can be added based on need.

### T215.27: Add benchmarking tools to tutorial
**Status**: Optional Enhancement
**Rationale**: Basic performance shown. Advanced benchmarking tools can be added later.
