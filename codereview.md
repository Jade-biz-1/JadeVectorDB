- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: The error handling system using `std::expected` with detailed `ErrorInfo` structures is well-designed.
- **Modular Architecture**: Services are appropriately separated (VectorStorageService, DatabaseService, SimilaritySearchService, etc.)
- **Performance-Oriented Design**: Use of SIMD operations, memory-mapped files, and cache-friendly data layouts aligns with performance requirements.

#### Areas of Concern
- **Incomplete Implementation of Some Services**: While core functionality is implemented, some distributed features appear to use placeholder implementations in the API layer.
- **Memory Management**: Need to verify deep-dive analysis of memory pooling and custom allocators implementation.
- **Concurrency Safety**: Need to verify implementation of lock-free data structures mentioned in research.

### 2. API Design

#### REST API

// Example from vector_storage.h - good design with distributed considerations
class VectorStorageService {
private:
    std::shared_ptr<logging::Logger> logger_;
    std::shared_ptr<ShardingService> sharding_service_;
    std::shared_ptr<QueryRouter> query_router_;
    std::shared_ptr<ReplicationService> replication_service_;
    // ...
};
```
