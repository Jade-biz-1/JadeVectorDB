# JadeVectorDB Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-10-10

## Active Technologies
- C++20 or later (for high-performance vector operations, SIMD optimizations, and modern concurrency features) + Eigen (linear algebra), OpenBLAS/BLIS (vector operations), FlatBuffers (serialization), Apache Arrow (in-memory analytics), gRPC (service communication), Google Test (testing framework), Boost (utility libraries) (001-we-are-going)
- Custom binary format optimized for vector operations with memory-mapped files for large dataset handling; supports Apache Arrow for in-memory operations and FlatBuffers for network serialization (001-we-are-going)
