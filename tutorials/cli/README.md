## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you'll need:

1. A running instance of JadeVectorDB (typically available at http://localhost:8080)
2. Access to one of the CLI implementations (Python, Shell, or JavaScript)
3. An API key for authentication (if required by your server setup)

## CLI Implementation Notes

These tutorials use examples that work across all three CLI implementations (Python, Shell, and JavaScript). Command differences between implementations are noted where applicable.

If you haven't installed the CLI tools yet, refer to the examples directory for setup instructions for each implementation:

- [Python CLI Examples](../../examples/cli/python-examples.md)
- [Shell CLI Examples](../../examples/cli/shell-examples.md)
- [JavaScript CLI Examples](../../examples/cli/javascript-examples.md)

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues during the tutorials:

1. Check that your JadeVectorDB instance is running
2. Verify your API key and URL settings
3. Look at the CLI help (`--help` flag) for specific commands
4. Refer to the examples directory for additional usage patterns
