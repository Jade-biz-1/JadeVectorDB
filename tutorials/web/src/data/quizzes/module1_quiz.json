      "difficulty": "easy",
      "options": [
        "Store and search high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Vector databases are specifically designed to store, manage, and search high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They excel at similarity search and semantic understanding, which traditional databases struggle with.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about what makes vector databases different from traditional databases",

      "correctAnswer": [0, 1, 2],
      "explanation": "JadeVectorDB supports cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product for vector similarity calculations. Levenshtein distance is used for string comparison, not vector similarity.",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "All vectors in a database must have the same dimension to enable meaningful similarity comparisons. The dimension is set when creating the database and cannot be changed.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": [0, 1],
      "explanation": "The required components are the vector ID (unique identifier) and the vector values (numerical array matching the database dimension). Metadata is optional but highly recommended for filtering. Creation timestamp is typically auto-generated.",
      "hints": [
        "This question may have multiple correct answers",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In KNN search, K represents the number of nearest (most similar) vectors to return from the database. For example, K=5 returns the 5 most similar vectors to your query.",

      "points": 10,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "This is false. For cosine similarity, higher values (closer to 1) indicate more similar vectors, while lower values (closer to -1) indicate less similar or opposite vectors. A value of 0 indicates orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about the range of cosine similarity values",
