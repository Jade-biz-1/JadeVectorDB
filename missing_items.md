# Missing Items for Implementation Kick-off

This document lists items that are recommended to be created or clarified before full-scale implementation begins. While the existing documentation is comprehensive, addressing these points will prevent potential ambiguity for the development team.

---

## 1. Detailed UI/UX Wireframes or Mockups

**Status:** Missing

**Description:**
The `spec.md` mentions a comprehensive web-based UI for administrators and data scientists (UI-004 to UI-013), and the `plan.md` specifies it will be built with Next.js and shadcn. However, there are no visual guides, wireframes, or mockups that show the intended layout, user flow, or visual design of this interface.

**Impact:**
Without a clear visual target, the frontend development process will be inefficient, relying on trial-and-error to meet unspecified design goals. This can lead to a disconnected user experience and significant rework.

**Recommendation:**
Create a set of low-fidelity wireframes or high-fidelity mockups for the key UI screens, including:
- The main cluster monitoring dashboard.
- The database creation and configuration view.
- The data exploration and query interface.

## 2. Developer Onboarding and Environment Setup Guide

**Status:** Partially Missing

**Description:**
The `tasks.md` file lists setup tasks (T001-T008), and the `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh` script exists. However, there is no single, consolidated guide that walks a new developer through the process of setting up their local development environment. This includes cloning the repository, installing all required dependencies (C++, Node.js, Python, Docker), configuring the build system, and running the application locally for the first time using the `docker-compose.yml`.

**Impact:**
Onboarding new developers will be slow and error-prone, with each person having to piece together the setup process from multiple documents and scripts.

**Recommendation:**
Create a `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` in the root directory that provides clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up a complete local development environment from scratch.

## 3. Finalized `quickstart.md`

**Status:** Incomplete / Potentially Inconsistent

**Description:**
The `inconsistencies.md` report noted a conflict between the API path in `quickstart.md` and `spec.md`. While the `spec.md` and `tasks.md` have been aligned, the `quickstart.md` itself has not been finalized to reflect the correct API usage and provide a simple, end-to-end example for a new user.

**Impact:**
The first experience for a new user trying out the API will be confusing or broken if the quickstart guide is inaccurate.

**Recommendation:**
Review and update `specs/002-check-if-we/quickstart.md` to be fully consistent with the final API design in `vector-db-api.yaml`. It should contain a simple, runnable example of creating a database, adding a vector, and performing a search.

## 4. Detailed Data Model for `vector-db-api.yaml`

**Status:** Partially Missing

**Description:**
The `vector-db-api.yaml` file is very detailed for endpoints but the schemas (e.g., `Database`, `Vector`, `SearchRequest`) are defined within the OpenAPI spec itself. The `data-model.md` provides a higher-level view. For implementation, it would be beneficial to have the request/response body schemas for the key API endpoints extracted into their own clear, easy-to-reference examples.

**Impact:**
Developers will have to navigate the large `vector-db-api.yaml` file to understand the exact structure of expected request and response bodies, which can be cumbersome.

**Recommendation:**
In the `specs/002-check-if-we/contracts/` directory, create a few example files like `examples.json` that provide clear JSON examples for the bodies of key requests and responses, such as:
- `POST /databases` (CreateDatabaseRequest)
- `POST /databases/{databaseId}/vectors/batch` (Batch Vector Storage Request)
- `POST /databases/{databaseId}/search/advanced` (AdvancedSearchRequest and SearchResponse)
