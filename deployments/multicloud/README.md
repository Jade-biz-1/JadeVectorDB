# Multi-Cloud Deployment for JadeVectorDB

This document explains how to deploy JadeVectorDB across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP) using the templates and tools provided in this repository.

## Overview

JadeVectorDB supports deployment across major cloud providers with a consistent and cloud-agnostic approach. This allows you to:
- Deploy to your preferred cloud provider
- Migrate between cloud providers with minimal configuration changes
- Implement hybrid or multi-cloud architectures
- Leverage the best features of each cloud platform

## Deployment Options

### 1. Cloud-Specific Templates

We provide ready-to-use templates for each major cloud provider:

- **AWS**: CloudFormation templates and EKS configurations
- **Azure**: ARM templates and Bicep configurations for AKS
- **GCP**: Deployment Manager templates and Terraform configurations for GKE

### 2. Cloud-Agnostic Deployment Script

We also provide a unified deployment script that works across all cloud providers with minimal configuration changes.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying JadeVectorDB to any cloud provider, ensure you have:

### General Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running
- `kubectl` installed and configured
- `helm` installed and configured

### Cloud-Specific Prerequisites

#### AWS
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials
- `eksctl` installed (optional but recommended)
- IAM permissions to create EKS clusters, EC2 instances, and related resources

#### Azure
- Azure CLI installed and logged in (`az login`)
- AKS resource provider registered
- IAM permissions to create AKS clusters and related resources

#### GCP
- Google Cloud SDK installed and configured (`gcloud auth login`)
- Project ID selected (`gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`)
- IAM permissions to create GKE clusters and related resources

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Using the Cloud-Agnostic Deployment Script

The simplest way to deploy JadeVectorDB is using the provided script:

```bash
cd deployments/multicloud

# Deploy to AWS
./deploy-jadevectordb.sh -p aws -n my-jadevectordb-cluster -r us-west-2 --create-cluster

# Deploy to Azure
./deploy-jadevectordb.sh -p azure -n my-jadevectordb-cluster -r eastus --create-cluster

# Deploy to GCP
./deploy-jadevectordb.sh -p gcp -n my-jadevectordb-cluster -r us-central1 -i my-gcp-project --create-cluster
```

The script will:
1. Validate prerequisites
2. Create a new cluster if requested
3. Configure kubectl to connect to the cluster
4. Deploy JadeVectorDB using the Helm chart
5. Wait for the deployment to be ready

### Method 2: Using Cloud-Specific Templates

#### AWS Deployment

##### Using CloudFormation
1. Navigate to the AWS Console CloudFormation service
2. Upload and deploy the template from `deployments/aws/jadevectordb-stack.yaml`
3. Follow the deployment wizard, providing required parameters

##### Using EKS
1. Install and configure `eksctl`
2. Deploy using the configuration: `eksctl create cluster -f deployments/aws/eks-cluster.yaml`
3. Deploy JadeVectorDB using Helm: `helm install jadevectordb ../../charts/jadevectordb`

#### Azure Deployment

##### Using ARM Templates
1. Navigate to the Azure Portal
2. Create a resource using the template in `deployments/azure/jadevectordb-aks-template.json`
3. Provide the required parameters

##### Using Bicep
1. Install the Bicep CLI
2. Deploy using: `az deployment group create --template-file jadevectordb-aks-template.bicep --resource-group myResourceGroup`

#### GCP Deployment

##### Using Deployment Manager
1. Ensure Deployment Manager API is enabled
2. Deploy using: `gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-deployment --config deployments/gcp/jadevectordb-deployment.yaml`

##### Using Terraform
1. Install Terraform
2. Navigate to the GCP deployment directory
3. Initialize: `terraform init`
4. Plan: `terraform plan -var="project_id=MY_PROJECT_ID"`
5. Apply: `terraform apply -var="project_id=MY_PROJECT_ID"`

## Configuration

### Cloud-Agnostic Configuration

The cloud-agnostic configuration is defined in `deployments/multicloud/jadevectordb-config.yaml`. You can customize:

- Number of replicas
- Resource requirements (CPU, memory)
- Storage configuration
- Environment variables
- Health check parameters

### Cloud-Specific Configuration

Each cloud provider has specific configuration options:

- **AWS**: Instance types, VPC settings, security groups
- **Azure**: VM sizes, resource groups, availability zones
- **GCP**: Machine types, regions, IAM permissions

## Architecture Considerations

### High Availability
- Deploy with at least 3 nodes for cluster mode
- Use multiple availability zones if supported by the cloud provider
- Enable autoscaling to handle load variations

### Security
- Use private clusters when possible
- Enable network policies
- Implement proper IAM roles and permissions
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit

### Monitoring
- Enable cloud provider's monitoring services (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Cloud Monitoring)
- Configure the built-in Prometheus and Grafana monitoring
- Set up alerts for key metrics

## Cost Optimization

### Right-Sizing
- Choose appropriate instance/machine types for your workload
- Use reserved instances or commitments when applicable
- Configure autoscaling to optimize resource usage

### Storage
- Use the right storage class for your needs (SSD vs standard)
- Consider storage lifecycle policies where applicable

## Multi-Cloud Strategies

### Disaster Recovery
- Deploy to multiple regions or cloud providers
- Implement cross-region replication if required
- Test failover procedures regularly

### Performance Optimization
- Deploy closer to your users/data
- Leverage edge computing where applicable
- Use CDN for cached content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cluster Creation Failures
1. Verify IAM permissions for your cloud provider
2. Check for quota limits
3. Validate region availability

#### Deployment Failures
1. Check the cluster status
2. Verify kubectl connectivity
3. Review the Helm chart values
4. Examine pod logs: `kubectl logs -l app=jadevectordb -n jadevectordb`

#### Network Connectivity
1. Ensure security groups/firewall rules allow necessary traffic
2. Verify load balancer creation and configuration
3. Check for any VPC/Peering issues

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check cluster status
kubectl get nodes

# Check JadeVectorDB pods
kubectl get pods -n jadevectordb

# Check JadeVectorDB service
kubectl get svc -n jadevectordb

# Get JadeVectorDB logs
kubectl logs -l app=jadevectordb -n jadevectordb

# Port forward for local testing
kubectl port-forward -n jadevectordb svc/jadevectordb 8080:8080
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a minimal deployment and scale as needed
2. **Monitor Costs**: Regularly review and optimize resource usage
3. **Secure Access**: Limit access to necessary personnel and use VPNs when possible
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep your deployment templates and software up to date
5. **Backup Strategy**: Implement appropriate backup and recovery procedures
6. **Performance Testing**: Perform load testing to ensure your deployment meets requirements

## Next Steps

After successful deployment, consider:

1. Configuring your applications to connect to JadeVectorDB
2. Setting up monitoring and alerting
3. Implementing backup and disaster recovery procedures
4. Planning for scaling based on your usage patterns
